# CNN-Strawberry-Detection

##Developed a CNN architecture for strawberry detection by truncating pre-trained model "MobileNetV3Large" at block 14 and adding a custom encoder-decoder architecture to generate high-resolution heatmaps for precise strawberry localization, addressing challenges such as lighting variability, partial obstructions, and background clutter.
